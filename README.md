# Laser Tag Game

## by Anthony De Belen

### Project Background: 
A project that was started during my senior year in UC Riverside for the course CS122A - Intermediate Embedded and Real Time Systems.

### Introduction:
Previously called "Shooter Game", this laser tag game was inspired by arcade games which I frequently go to during my childhood days. The player will have control on the movement of the laser attached to a stepper motor. There will be a total of 8 targets labeled from 1 through 8. The motor is controlled by two motion sensors that, once triggered, will rotate the motor 45 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. The LCD will display the score and status of the game.
